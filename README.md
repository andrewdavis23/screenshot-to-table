# screenshot-to-table
I can't take it anymore! This program will convert a screenshot of a table into a dataframe using computer vision (cv2) and optical character recognition (py-tesseract).

No matter how many times you ask, it just isn't enough.  I swear, it's times like these that I wish AI would conquer us all.

The file 'screenshot to table demo.py' will demonstrate the image processing that is taking place in the program.  All of the file names for the test images are in the python code.  Just comment out all but one.

```python 3
# black all borders, odd formatting, row/col headers
# file = r'//n0adcdata3/redirect$/nuajd15/My Documents/Python/image to table/complex.jpg'

# standard, black all borders format
file = r'//n0adcdata3/redirect$/nuajd15/My Documents/Python/image to table/all borders simple.jpg'
```
